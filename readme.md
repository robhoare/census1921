## Partial street index for 1921 Census Toronto

This is an attempt to create a partial street index for the
Canada 1921 census images on Ancestry, for Toronto only.

It relies on the subdivision descriptions on Ancestry listing
all the streets.  Where they ar present, they do, but around
half of the descriptions are currently missing.

So this index will only list around half the streets in the five 
Toronto electoral districts.

In addition, some Toronto City streets are within neighbouring
districts such as York.  These have not yet been added, but can done
next.

Unfortunately, the way the districts are described is different
for areas outside Toronto, so they cannot be added to this index.

The results are shown in the /index subdirectory, by electoral
district.  Each file is sorted by street name, then shows the
subdistrict (and ward and polling district).

When the outlying areas of the city (in York etc) have been
added a consolidated index can be produced.

Just to repeat: this is a partial index.  Around half of all
streets will be missing.
